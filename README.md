# Text Generation with Markov Chains

Welcome to the Text Generation with Markov Chains project! This repository contains code and resources to create a text generation model using Markov Chains.

## Introduction

Markov Chains are mathematical systems that transition from one state to another within a finite set of possible states. In the context of text generation, we use Markov Chains to predict the next word in a sequence based on the probability distribution of the previous words. This project demonstrates how to implement a text generator using Markov Chains in Python.

## Features

- Generate text based on an input corpus
- Adjustable n-gram size for different levels of context
- Simple and intuitive API for text generation
- Support for custom input texts

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-generation-markov-chains.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd text-generation-markov-chains
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To generate text using the Markov Chains model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your input text file and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Run the script to generate text:

```bash
python generate_text.py --input data/your_input_file.txt --output generated_text.txt --ngram_size 2 --length 100
```

- `--input`: Path to the input text file.
- `--output`: Path to the output text file where the generated text will be saved.
- `--ngram_size`: Size of the n-gram (default is 2).
- `--length`: Length of the generated text (default is 100 words).

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the text generator:

Generate text with a 2-gram model:

```bash
python generate_text.py --input data/sample.txt --output generated_text.txt --ngram_size 2 --length 100
```

Generate text with a 3-gram model:

```bash
python generate_text.py --input data/sample.txt --output generated_text.txt --ngram_size 3 --length 150
```
